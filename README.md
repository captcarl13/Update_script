# update_script

Two scripts for updating macOS and Raspberry Pi OS.

macOS version requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

`startmeup.sh`: RPi first-time install for packages used in all Pi installs.

Raspberry Pi OS version also includes provisions updating `zsh` and `roots.hint` if using Unbound with Pi-Hole. See code for lines to comment out if not using either.
